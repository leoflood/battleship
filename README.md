# Vite TypeScript Application

This is a Vite application template with TypeScript. To get started, follow the instructions below.

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd battleship-app
   ```

2. Install the project dependencies using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Development

To start the development server and run the app, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start a local development server, and your app will be available at `http://localhost:3000` or another port. Any changes you make to the source code will be hot-reloaded automatically, allowing you to see the results in real-time.

## Building for Production

To build the application for production, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command will generate an optimized production build in the `dist` directory. You can then deploy this build to your hosting platform of choice.

## Customize

Feel free to customize this template to suit your project's specific needs. You can modify the source code in the `src` directory, update the configuration in `vite.config.js`, and add or remove dependencies as required.
